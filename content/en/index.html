    <p>I am very pleased to announce you, that the practice will reopen rather soon, on 2nd of August 2012.
    I will be glad to meet you personally.
    </p>


    <p>From August, <a href="http://www.lindenhofgruppe.ch/de/weitere-angebote/ivf/" target="_blank"> the lab at the Lindenhofspital </a> will be open again as well.
    </p>

	<p>During July, the practice is renovated, and some new devices are being installed. The practice is closed therefore.
	Amongst others the possibility of electronical records will make the communication easier.
	</p>
	<p>
    During July, you can reach me by email <a href="mailto:info@drbleichenbacher.ch">info@drbleichenbacher.ch </a>,
    via <a href="/en/contact/"> the contact form </a> or in written form.
	I will answer as quickly as possible.
    </p>

	<p>If you would like to start with a stimulation in July already, or just to discuss a treatment, there are possiblities to phone together eg,
	or to meet us in Lucerne, where I will be in employment until the end of July, or elsewhere according to your convenience.
