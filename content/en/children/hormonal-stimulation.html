<h1>Hormonal Stimulation</h1> 
<p class="lead"> 
The egg-ripening and the ovulation can be stimulated with hormones. 
</p>

<p>If the cause for the unfulfilled desire to have children is a late or a missing ovulation,
it can be supported by a hormone treatment in the form of tablets (Clomiphencitrat such as   Clomid® or Serophene® from the 3rd -7th cycle days).
After you have taken the tablets, on the twelfth cycle day we control with an ultrasound the number and the size of the follicles.
The ovulation can be induced with a hormone injection (Beta-HCG, such as Choriomon®, Ovitrelle®, Pregnyl®, Profasi®).
</p>

<p>If the effect of the tablets isn’t sufficient, therapy can also be administered with low dose hormone injections
(FSH, such as Fostimon®, Gonal F®, Puregon® or HMG, such as Menopur®, Merional®).
Normally these injections begin at the third cycle day too. (Not later than the fifth.)
The first ultrasound control is made at the eighth cycle day. The ovulation has to be triggered by a hormone injection, as soon as a mature follicle is available.
The injections can be made directly under the skin, with modern preparations of today, so they can easy be applied on the woman’s or her partner’s own.
</p>

<p>In that the ovulation is triggered medicinally, it can be guaranteed that the fertile sperm are at the ideal time, shortly before the expected ovulation, in the fallopian tube.
</p>

<p>It is important, that the hormonal treatment is always carried out under ultrasound control,
so that a possible danger of especially higher level multiples (triplets and more) is recognized and the therapy can be canceled in time.
Because of this, before the first ultrasound control unprotected sexual intercourse shouldn’t take place.
</p>

<p>The hormonal therapy can be combined with other treatments:
