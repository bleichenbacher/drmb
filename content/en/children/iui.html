<h1>Intrauterine Insemination (IUI)</h1>

<p class="lead">This is the insertion of prepared semen into the uterus.
The insemination is particularly used in cases ranging from a light up to a moderate male fertility disorder,
which means there is a reduced number of normally formed and well moving sperm in the ejaculation.
</p>

<p>Normally, the insemination is combined with a <a href="/de/childen/hormonal-stimulation/">hormonal therapy</a>.
As soon as with ultra sound a mature follicle can be exposed, the ovulation is relayed with a hormone injection and either the next day or two days after the insemination is carried out.
To that the fresh semen is prepared in a nutrient solution and centrifuged, to obtain a concentrate (o.5 ml) of fertile sperm.
This is inserted in the partner’s uterus with a fine catheter.
</p>

<p>Since these well moving and fertile sperm are directly deposited in the uterus, they don’t have to overcome the sometimes tough mucus in the uterine cervix.
Finally, there are more “good“ sperm at the place of the fertilization in the fallopian tube.
Besides a minimum of sperm (Ideally 1-5 millions in the prepared semen), a clear fallopian tube is a prerequisite for this treatment.
Because of this, as a general rule we check the clearance of the fallopian tube by ultra sound (contrast agent sonography) or with a laparoscopy.
Provided the conditions are fulfilled, the pregnancy rate is at approximately 10-15% per try, whereby normally three tries are planned.
</p>

<p> Normally, the health insurance pays three inseminations per pregnancy.
But there can be restricting provisions; therefore it’s worth it to request a guarantee for costs prior.
We are happy to do this for you.
