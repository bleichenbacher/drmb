<h1>Assessment of Fertility</h1>

<p>Ideally the assessment includes both partners from the beginning and starts with a <a href="/en/children/first-appointment/"> detailed conversation</a>.
Of course, possibly existing results of earlier examinations are considered, so that these tests dont have to be repeated.
</p>

<p>Reasons for the sterility are found to be 30% related to the woman, 30% related to the man and 30% related to both. There is no reason found for the remaining 10%.
</p>
<p>	Bei der Abklärung geht es aber nicht darum, eine Schuld zuweisen zu können,
	sondern darum, eine Grundlage zu erhalten, um ein Behandlungskonzept aufstellen zu können, das möglichst alle Faktoren mitberücksichtigt.
</p>
<p>Basically, for a pregnancy 3 prerequisites have to be fulfilled:

<li>Regular ovulation</li>
<li>Enough sperm, that are capable to fertilize</li>
<li>Fallopian tube clearance</li>
</p>

<h3 id="Testzyklus">Test cycle
</h3>

<p>
In a so called test cycle at the beginning of the cycle the most important hormones and antibodies (infection protection) are determined in the blood.
Additionally, with ultrasound the functional reserves of the ovary can be evaluated at the beginning of the cycle
and from the 12th day of the cycle the ovulation and the structure of the endometrium  can be checked.
More blood samples in the second half of the cycle give information about the quality of the ovulation and the function of the corpus luteum.
</p>
<p>
Usually, in parallel the male fertility is checked by the help of a spermiogram (microscopic examination of a sperm sample).
</p>
<p>
It is also possible to check the Fallopian tube clearance during the test cycle.
Usually this happens by an ultrasound (contrast agent sonography) or by a laparoscopy.

<h3 id="Spermiogramm">Spermiogram
</h3>
<p>Evaluated is the number of sperm in the emission of semen (from ejaculation), the percentage of moving sperm and the percentage of normally formed sperm.
The according standard values are: at least 12 million moving sperm per millilitre are ejaculated, at least 32% of forward looking moving sperms and at least 4% of a normal form.
Because the values can falter considerably, also at a normal fertility, we recommend depending on the result two separate examinations, with an interval of at least three months.
With a clearly restricted spermiogram we recommend a proceeding examination at the specialist (urology or andrology).

<h3 id="Tubenfaktor">Checking of the fallopian tube clearance
</h3>

<h3 id="KMSonografie">Ultraschall (Kontrastmittelsonografie)
</h3>
<p>Implementation occurrs between the 8th and the 12th days of the cycle.
After an exposure of the outer uterine orifice with a vaginal speculum (like for the pap smear), a fine catheter is pushed into the uterine cavity.
With this catheter a contrast agent is given, which can be followed by the ultrasound on its way through the fallopian tube into the abdominal cavity.
The examination can cause menstruation-like cramps in the lower abdomen, but a narcosis isnt necessary.
Sometimes it causes immediately after a feeling of sickness or low blood pressure.
If the fallopian tube cant be evaluated clearly with this technique, we normally recommend a laparoscopy.

<h3 id="Laparoskopie">Laparoscopy
</h3>
<p>Implementation between the 8th and the 12th cycle days, ambulant under a general anaesthesia.
By a small cut in the navel, an optic is led into the abdomen, by which all the abdominal cavity can be observed.
The clearance of the fallopian tube is checked, by injecting blue colour into the uterine cavity, of which the withdrawal can be followed directly on the screen.
We especially recommend this examination when there are hints for an endometriosis (severe pains at the menstruation and/or at sexual intercourse), scars or adhesions (abdomen intervention in the medical history, inflammation of the fallopian tubes, ectopic pregnancy, Chlamydia antibody), or if the contrast agent sonography wasnt clear. Usually a hysteroscopy (the endoscopy of the uterine cavity) is done at the same time.
