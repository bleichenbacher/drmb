<h1>In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) and Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI) </h1>

<p class="lead">In contrast to the <a href="/en/children/iui/">intrauterine insemination </a>, in IVF (In Vitro Fertilization), in ICSI (intracytoplasmic sperm injection) the combine of the egg cells taken from the woman’s  ovaries (oocytes) and the man’s spermatocytes (sperm) occurs outside of the body in a test tube, just “in vitro” (lat. Vitrum = glass).
eben "in vitro" (lat. Vitrum = Glas).
</p>

<p>The fusion of the genetic material (=fertilization) is just as independent as otherwise.
“Artificial” is actually just referring to the place of the fertilization.
Therefore I prefer to speak from “test tube”- or “In Vitro”- instead of “artificial” fertilization.
</p>

<p>The difference between IVF and ICSI is just the way that the spermatozoon comes into the egg cell.
In IVF one of many spermatozoa enters independently into the egg cell.
In ICSI one individual spermatozoa is injected into the egg cell under the microscope with the help of a micropipette (very fine needle).
</p>

<p>Normally, the sperms can be obtained from an ejaculation of course without any problems.
The egg cells however have to be retrieved from the vagina shortly before the ovulation out of the ovary through a small intervention.
Usually, the ovaries are stimulated with a hormone therapy to mature approximately 10-15 egg cells, instead of only one,
like in the normal cycle, so that by the intervention several egg cells can be obtained.
</p>

<p>If then several egg cells are fertilized, a part of it in the so called pre-nucleus stage is frozen
and later inserted into the uterus, without the need of another complicate hormone therapy by a so called thawing cycle.
</p>

<p>If there is no sperm in the ejaculation, then sometimes sperm can be obtained out of a tissue sample of the testicle(=TESE, testicular sperm extraction).
</p>

<h4>Reasons for IVF treatment
</h4>

<ul>
<li>Fallopian tubes irreparably closed or limited in their function by infections, endometriosis or operations (prevention or sometimes after an appendectomy
</li>
<li>Male fertility disorder
</li>
<li>After an unsuccessful <a href="/en/children/iui/">insemination</a> (usually after three trials)
</li>
</ul>

<h4>Reasons for an ICSI</h4>

<ul>
<li>Serious male fertility disorder
</li>
<li>Missing or bad fertilization at the IVF
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Chances of success
</h3>

<p>The chances for a pregnancy after an IVF/ICSI are primarily age depending, according to the age depending acceptance of the fertility.
At the age of 35 there is a 30% chance, at the age of 40 there is a 20% chance and above the age of 40 there is a 10% chance per cycle, with a clear decreasing tendency.
Of course, the chance also depends on individual factors. We are happy to advise you in this regard.



<h3>Procedure</h3>

<h4>Stimulation</h4>

<p>The ovaries are stimulated with hormone injections, according to an individual protocol, in order to form ideally 10-15 follicles.
You or your partner will be instructed in regards to the administration of the injections.
With the help of regular ultrasounds and blood controls, the growth of the follicles is accurately monitored.
</p>

<h4>Oocyte pickup</h4>

<p>After triggering of the ovulation by a ß-HCG injection, the follicles are punctured with a needle from the vagina and the liquid with the included egg cells is aspirated.
Normally, this happens under a light narcosis (analgosedation, under control of an anaesthesia team).
I will perform this pickup at the IVF laboratory and a few hours later, you will be able to go home.
</p>

<h4>Fertilization
</h4>
<p>After the puncture, the egg cell and the sperm are brought together in the test tube.
Respectively with ICSI, one spermatozoon is microinjected into each oocyte.
The further development takes place in the incubator under optimal environmental conditions (temperature, nutrient solution, pH-value etc.).
</p>
<p>24 hours later, the embryologist can see if and how many eggs are effectively fertilized.

<h4>Cryopreservation
</h4>

<p>If there are more zygotes (=pronuclear stages or PNs) than needed for the transfer, they can be frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen.
They can be brought into the uterus later in a thawing cycle.
Under the Swiss legislation the zygotes may not be stored for more than 5 years.
</p>

<h4>Embryo transfer
</h4>

<p>2-3 days after the pickup, again in the laboratory, usually 2 embryos are placed into the uterine cavity.
This happens through a very thin catheter from the vagina and is painless.
</p>
<h4>Pregnancy test
</h4>
<p>14 days after the transfer, the pregnancy hormone is determined in blood.
If the result is positive, an ultrasound check 2-3 weeks later will show whether teh pregnancy develops normally.
The following pregnancy controls are usually performed by your gynaecologist or your family doctor.
</p>


<h4>Thawing cycle
</h4>
<p>If we were able to freeze zygotes previously, a thawing cycle can be carried out at the non-occurrence of a pregnancy, or also at a new desire to have children.
To do this, either the endometrium is built up specifically with hormone tablets or hormone plasters,
or the ideal moment for the implantation is determined with ultrasound and blood controls in a natural or stimulated cycle.
</p>
<p>After thawing of the egg cells and the first cell divisions, two embryos can be brought in the uterine cavity again.
